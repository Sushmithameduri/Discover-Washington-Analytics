# 🌲 Discover Washington: Web Analytics, GA4 Telemetry & Data Storytelling

> **Project Status:** The live site was officially decommissioned post-launch. This repository serves as a comprehensive data portfolio showcasing the digital behavioral data, GA4 telemetry, and Looker Studio dashboards built to track the platform's performance.

## 📌 Strategic Overview
An end-to-end digital analytics project where I configured a regional tourism platform and implemented a complete web analytics framework. The objective was to capture complex digital behavioral data using **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**, visualize it via **Looker Studio**, and extract actionable business insights to drive content strategy.

## 🎯 Business Goals & KPI Framework
To measure the platform's success, I established a structured problem-solving framework tracking 5 core business outcomes:

| Business Goal | KPI / Metric Tracked | Target Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Maximize Audience Acquisition** | Daily Active Users | Drive top-of-funnel growth |
| **2. Improve Content Effectiveness** | Views per Session | Increase deep-site navigation |
| **3. Maximize User Engagement** | Average Session Duration | Retain user attention |
| **4. Ensure Consistent Access** | % Returning Users | Build audience loyalty |
| **5. Validate Navigation Clarity** | Bounce Rate | Identify UX friction points |

## 📊 Analytics Dashboards & Performance


### Key Performance Outcomes (Phase 3 Growth)
* **Active User Growth:** +82.4% (reached 31 baseline users in 7 days)
* **Engagement Health:** Maintained an optimal **38% Bounce Rate** alongside an exceptional **8 min 59 sec Average Time on Site**, proving high content relevance.
* **Event Tracking:** Successfully recorded 946 digital behavioral events, isolating high-value user interactions.

## 💡 Actionable Insights & Strategic Recommendations
By mining the GA4 data, I translated raw traffic metrics into clear solutions and content recommendations:

* **Traffic Forecasting & Publishing Strategy:** * *Data:* Traffic heavily peaked on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
  * *Action:* Adjusted the content calendar to publish new assets on Wednesdays, ensuring pages were indexed and available just before the weekend traffic surge.
* **Platform Optimization Focus:**
  * *Data:* 100% of users accessed the site via Desktop, with Chrome (~80%) as the dominant browser. 
  * *Action:* Recommended suspending mobile-optimization resources to prioritize high-fidelity desktop UI enhancements.
* **Content Media Performance:**
  * *Data:* "Chihuly Garden and Glass" (65 views, 123 events) significantly outperformed legacy national park content.
